# Aluminum Built Games
Aluminum is a (currently closed source) game engine I am making in my free time. Currently, the engine only supports Windows. However, there are plans to support Linux and the hope to support consoles. This repository contains publicly available games I have made with the Aluminum game engine. The list is as follows:
- [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/aryan-sinhala349/aluminum-built-games/releases/tag/tic-tac-toe-v1.0.0)
- [Breakout](https://github.com/aryan-sinhala349/aluminum-built-games/releases/tag/breakout-v1.0.0)
- [Rotating Arrow](https://github.com/aryan-sinhala349/aluminum-built-games/releases/tag/rotating-arrow-v1.0.0)
