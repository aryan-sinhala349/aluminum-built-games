# Aluminum Built Games
Aluminum is a (currently closed source) game engine I am making in my free time. Currently, the engine only supports Windows. However, there are plans to support Linux and the hope to support consoles. This repository contains publicly available games I have made with the Aluminum game engine. The list is as follows:
- Tic-Tac-Toe
